# Terminalia

<p align="center">
  <strong>Agentic 3D open-world generation at scale — on any GPU, or none at all.</strong>
</p>

---

## What is this?

Terminalia turns one text prompt into an **explorable, engine-ready 3D world**:

```
"volcanic island with a ruined temple and pirate cove"
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SPEC      prompt → structured world plan             │
│ TERRAIN   procedural heightfields, agent-authored    │
│ LAYOUT    flat-area site selection + composition     │
│ ASSETS    TRELLIS.2-4B image → PBR meshes            │
│ PLACE     contact-ratio search (no floating props)   │
│ REFINE    BlenderMCP render-inspect-refine loop      │
│ EXPORT    UE 5.8 · Unity · Godot · glTF · flythrough │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Inspired by Tencent's WorldClaw paper (arXiv 2608.05248) — but built entirely
from open models and swappable compute backends. No Tencent code required.

## Highlights

- **Any hardware** — RTX 3060 12GB to DGX Spark 128GB, plus Comfy Cloud credits
  and RunPod serverless for no-GPU users. Quality presets scale automatically
  via named `GpuProfile`s.
- **Deterministic worlds** — same seed, same world. Every stage re-runs cleanly.
- **`world.json` as truth** — one pydantic schema carries the whole state;
  every stage reads and writes it.
- **Agent-native** — each stage is a plain function with JSON-shaped I/O; agent
  skill definitions included.
- **Engine-ready output** — Unreal Python import macro, Unity editor script,
  Godot scene, generic glTF manifest.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e .
export COMFY_CLOUD_API_KEY=...   # or run local ComfyUI — auto-detected
python -m terminalia generate \
    --prompt "volcanic island with a ruined temple and pirate cove" \
    --name my-first-world --seed 42
```

Then export wherever:

```python
from terminalia.export import write_ue_import_script
write_ue_import_script("worlds/my-first-world", world)
```

## Compute backends

| Backend | Auth | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local ComfyUI | none | free | auto-detected; any port |
| Comfy Cloud | API key | credits | works from a laptop with no GPU |
| RunPod serverless | API key | $/sec | burst rendering, cold starts |
| Custom HTTP | varies | varies | any ComfyUI-compatible URL |

Hardware tiers: 12GB (512 preset) → 24GB (1024 cascade) → 32GB+ (1536 cascade,
full decode) → 128GB (max steps, bf16 video). See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status & honesty

`v0.2` — terrain engine, placement search, asset bindings, layout selection,
engine exporters, and video-stage specs are implemented and smoke-tested.
The Blender refine loop and Wan/LTX flythrough execution are wired but not yet
end-to-end tested in-repo. The README will always say exactly this much.
